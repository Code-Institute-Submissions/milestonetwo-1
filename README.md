## Testing

To Test this Project locally I used Fenix webserver installed on my development Machine this would allow me to run the javascript required and test locally.    

I used Developer tools to Console.log data to the Chrome Console for debugging data as I was building graphs this allowed to change data in the DOM. I also used the device toolbar to view across devices even though D3 and DC dose not render responsive graphs and the site was designed to be viewed purely on large screen devices.    

I selected a range of different values across the graphs on the dashboard to check that all graphs were redendering correctly and also updating as required. I also cross referenced with the CSV file through the chrome console.    

I tested my code with W3C Markup and CSS Validator to Check compliance. 

## Deployment

I have used Github for Version Control and Github Pages for Deployment.  

I used Linux Terminal to push the project to Github and from repository settings enabled github pages.
